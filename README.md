A batch based application with shortcuts. This program does not work without editing the textfile. This will be fixed in future updates.
--------------------
Changelog 09.02.2026
Now it is compatible with other machines and made universal. Changed from my local machine name to a universal prefix. %USERPROFILE%
Added some more sections and shortcuts. This program requires you to have Visual Studio Code, Docker Desktop and CLion to use all functionality.
